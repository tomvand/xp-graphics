# 0. White balance
The Enhanced Skyscapes lighting appears too yellow. Use a white balance LUT to correct before tuning further.

whitebalance6: ok. Perhaps *slightly* blue.

Consider separately tuning light and shadow?

# 1. Daytime sky color matching
Since the sky colors are fixed in Enhanced Skyscapes, find a LUT to match the color to reference pictures.
